*Goal:* The goal of this project was to analyze vehicle fuel efficiency trends over time, focusing on the impact of vehicle types, fuel types, and regulations on the average miles per gallon (MPG). I aimed to build machine learning models to understand these relationships and to predict MPG based on various vehicle attributes. Through exploratory data analysis, I visualized changes in fuel efficiency across different vehicle categories over decades, examined the correlation between vehicle attributes and fuel efficiency, and identified outliers.

The models incorporated features such as vehicle type, engine displacement, and year of manufacture to predict the combined MPG. I experimented with different machine learning algorithms to find the most effective model, and tuned it for better performance. I conducted cross-validation to ensure the model's reliability and used feature importance analysis to understand the impact of each feature on the model's predictions. The final model provided insights into the factors contributing to fuel efficiency, which can inform manufacturers and policymakers about trends and potential areas for improvement.

*Hypothesis:* Vehicle fuel efficiency has improved over the years due to advancements in vehicle technology and stricter environmental regulations.

*Analysis Focus:* Compare fuel efficiency across years and vehicle types.
